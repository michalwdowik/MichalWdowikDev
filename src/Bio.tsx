    In 2021, while maintaining my e-commerce shop and making basic tweaks to Shopify's templates, 
    I encountered HTML for the first time. It sparked the idea of picking up programming. 
    As I was completing my Master's degree, I wanted to learn something extra that would enable 
    me to create an e-commerce shop or app from scratch. My journey began with Swift, but upon
     discovering that JavaScript aligned more closely with my core interests, I transitioned to web development.
      After a few months of learning JS/CSS/HTML, I started discovering React. I have successfully completed two React projects.
